# pymerge
Few scripts to merge multiple excel tables into one result table, if you have a lot of similar documents from different departments
## Project
was made to simplify proccess of merging for 50+ tables of same type
## How to?
In "Data1" and "Data2" folders you can find samples of each form of tables. Using .py scripts (here used such modules as os (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) and re (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)) you can get result table, which will be joint table for all example tables of this type (i.e for all tables whose name include specified number).
